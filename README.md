# AutoRegistration for Contao Open Source CMS

The extension allows to automatically login a Contao user after
registration or when the account is activated.


## Installation

Install the bundle via Composer:

```
composer require terminal42/contao-autoregistration

## Configuration

All configuration takes place in the registration module.

**WARNING:** In previous versions, the configuration was a
root page setting. This has been changed in V3, you need
to re-configure your registration module after an update!
